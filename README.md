# Motion-detection-and-tracking

This project demonstrates basic motion detection and tracking using OpenCV. The program detects movement in a video and highlights moving objects by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Overview

This project uses OpenCV to:
- Capture video frames.
- Detect differences between consecutive frames (i.e., detect motion).
- Apply image processing techniques to highlight the areas of motion.
- Save the output video with bounding boxes around the detected motion.

### Demo

Below is an example of how the motion detection works:

| Original Video | Detected Motion |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| ![Original](images/original_video_frame.png) | ![Motion Detected](images/motion_detected_frame.png) |
